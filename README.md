# EDA-and-Sentiment-Analysis-ZOMATO-Bangalore
Data has been analysed as given by Zomato Media Pvt. Ltd.. Sentiment analysis on reviews, submitted by customers, have been performed using an LSTM model.

I was always fascinated by the food culture of Bengaluru. Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. The number of restaurant are increasing day by day. Currently which stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. And new restaurants are opening every day. However it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain and over-licensing. This Zomato data aims at analysing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating for the place.

The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurants at different places in Bengaluru.

Using an LSTM model, sentiment analysis of reviews(classified as positive and negative) has been performed, submitted my customers and users.
